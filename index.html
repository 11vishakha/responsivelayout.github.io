        <h3>Dogs:Our best friends in sickness and in health</h3> <br>
        <article>
            <h4>How dogs keep you in good health</h4> <br>
            <p>Dogs can strengthen our health not just as we grow older, but also much, much earlier than that: before
                we are even born.
                Research published last year suggests that children who were exposed to dogs while still in the womb —
                as their mothers spent time around dogs during pregnancy — had a lower risk of developing eczema in
                early childhood.
                Also, children exposed to certain bacteria carried by dogs also experienced a reduction of asthma
                symptoms, the researchers noted.</p>

            <h4>Dogs make people feel good</h4> <br>
            <p>Perhaps the most intuitive benefit of sharing your life and home with a canine friend is that dogs give
                you “feel-good vibes” almost instantly.
                It is really difficult not to cheer up, even after a hard days work, when you are greeted with — often
                vocal — enthusiasm by a friendly dog.
                “Dogs make people feel good, and their only job is to help people in stressful situations feel better.”

        <h3>How Dogs Perceive Humans and How Humans Should Treat Their Pet Dogs: Linking Cognition With Ethics</h3> <br>

            <h4>Characterizing the Human-Dog Relationship: Biological Perspectives</h4> <br>
            <p>In this section, we will investigate the characteristics of the human-dog relationship by following the
                decisive question of how dogs adapt to the human environment. We will turn our attention to the latest
                research results from the fields of animal cognition and behavior. </p>

            <p>Due to domestication programs that had the goal of producing companions that work with or for humans, and
                thereby follow human commands, dogs may have acquired a special sensitivity to human gestures, speech,
                and behavior. Neither the chimpanzee, humans' closest living relative, nor the
                wolf, dogs' closest living relative, can understand and use human communicative cues as flexibly as the
                domestic dog.
